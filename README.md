## General info
This program is created to help feature students to see where they stand with their point scored on the admission exam at the SEBS (School of Economics and Business Sarajevo)


## Technologies

For this project I used:
* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook
* Visual Studio Code
* Microsoft Excel
* Online PDF to Excel converter

## Specifications

The first part was to convert the data from PDF (Portable Document Format) to Excel, I did that throught 
some online websites. Afther that I started to create the Logistic Regression in Python and to train the model, as I finished that part I moved on to create the GUI (Graphic User Interface).

Next up was to convert the .ipynb file to a python script, so I can integrate it into my GUI script. As all this was done I started to test the whole program.
After the testing was done I tried to create an exicutable file but pyinstaller had some issues on my PC so this part will come in the future.

When the whole programm was finished I started to create visualizations to have a better understanding who passed and who failed the admission exam. In this section I was deviding the students into groups:
* DL studenti
* Redovni studenti
* Redovni samofinansirajuÄ‡i studenti
* Studenti koji nisu zadovoljili prijemni ispit
